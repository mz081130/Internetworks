        <h2>IP addresses, Packets and Routing- What is the Internet</h2>

                <p>IP address is like a mailing address but for your devices. Current IP address are called IP4 and 32
                    bit hierarchy based address that were designed in 1973. IP addresses are country/region specific,
                    then sub-network and the device address. As they are 32 bits, so current IP4 address can be assigned
                    to 4 Billion unique devices, but as the number of devices on the internet are growing therefore we
                    are transitioning to IP6 which uses 128 bits and can have unto 340 Undecillion unique addresses.</p>

                <h3>Packets</h3>
                <p> Data Is share over the internet in units or packets, each packet has binary sequences up to 64K in
                    size. Just like physical mailing envelopes, it has the sender and receiverâ€™s information. These
                    packets travel through the electric wires, fiber optic cables and wireless networks.</p>

                <p>These packets travel via the distributed network/Internet and can take one of many routes which are
                    build for fault tolerance.These routes are directed by the Routers, which can be direct and
                    indirect. They are like traffic police and can reroute the traffic/packets if there is congestion or
                    the route is broken. More routers increases fault tolerance and increase reliability.</p>

                <p>TCP is like an inventory manager which upon the arrival makes sure that all the packets are received
                    and sends the confirmation back to the server, if some packets were loss during transit, it will
                    notify the server and will send the confirmation once received.</p>
